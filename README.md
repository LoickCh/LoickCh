# Welcome to my github repository! 
I code mainly in Python and have some knowledge of C++ and Julia. My work is mainly focused on 3D computer vision problems but I study more broadly DL, ML, RL, and optimization.

### Languages :
My learning of Python started in University through projects and improved greatly after reading [Fluent Python: 2nd edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) written by Luciano Ramalho. But I have also worked on other programming languages, either in an academic context or by working on projects.

But also: Matlab and Octave.

### Deep Learning Frameworks
Most of my projects are done in Pytorch, but I have also done internships in Thenao and Tensorflow. More recently, I started JaX for a Deep Reinforcement Learning project.

But also JaX and Theano.
