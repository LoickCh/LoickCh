# Welcome to my github repository! 

I am French engineer who codes mainly in Python and has some knowledge in C++ and Julia. My work is mainly focused on 3D computer vision problems but I study more broadly DL, ML, RL, and optimization.


### Languages :
My learning of Python started in University through projects and improved greatly after reading [Fluent Python: 2nd edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/) written by Luciano Ramalho and [Python Tricks: the book](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/) written by Dan Bader. 
But I have also worked on other programming languages, either in an academic context or by working on projects.

But also, [Matlab](https://fr.mathworks.com/), [Scilab](https://www.scilab.org/) and [Octave](https://octave.org/index.html).

### Deep Learning Frameworks
Most of my projects are done in [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), but I have also done internships in [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow). More recently, I started JaX for a Deep Reinforcement Learning project.

But also, [JaX](https://github.com/google/jax) and [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano).
